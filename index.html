        <div class="bottom-right">David Carson redefined the rules of<br>visual communication and design<br>culture, much like Paganini’s<br>techniques
            in classical performance<br>over a century prior. Carson<br>was a highly influential designer in<br>the late 1980’s
            and 1990’s, who<br>is best known for his “grunge” style<br>that breaks away from the traditional<br>regulations of
            graphic design.<br>His work is the ultimate symbol<br>of experimentation which can be<br>accredited in the
            regeneration of<br>young designers’ interest in the<br>medium. He perfectly captures the<br>need for revolution
            during that<br>time in his own words, “Graphic<br>design is a visual language. And<br>like any language, it needs to
            be<br>constantly evolving and changing to<br>remain relevant. </div>

                    <p>Carson’s work is the definition of personal style. He had very little education</p>
                    <p>in design so observed the techniques used in the pop culture that he enjoyed.</p>
                    <p>This allowed him to discover his eclectic style. The consistent elements of his</p>
                    <p>work are chaotic and unstructured typography, large and bold photographs, a lack</p>
                    <p>of a grid, and layering of gritty material. Many of his pieces can be described</p>
                    <p>as a grainy collage. Each artwork seems like a different style to the last because</p>
                    <p>Carson does not follow guides or rules. The only rule that he adheres to is</p>
                    <p>that he follows none, resulting in pure disorder guided by his own intuition. “His</p>
                    <p> work sought to reconnect with audiences for whom print had failed in its emotional range,</p>
                    <p> and as a result had often failed to engage readers at all.”</p>

                    <p>As humans, we are inclined to resist change. From an evolutionary standpoint, it may be</p>
                    <p>down to the fact that it was too dangerous to leave familiar places. This can be the</p>
                    <p>answer as to why Carson received such strong criticism to his work. He was accused of </p>
                    <p>having illegible designs and no style, and on the other end of the spectrum, using</p>
                    <p>style to hide the absence of a concept. Standing with his work and process, he argued </p>
                    <p>that creativity and emotional response is far more valuable than rule following and </p>
                    <p>lackluster communication. His famous quote, "Don’t confuse legibility with communication," </p>
                    <p>further reflects his belief that design travels beyond simplicity.</p>

    <p class="paganini">Paganini was a gifted musician and considered the greatest violinist of all time.</p>
    <p class="he">He was so talented at his craft that he was accused of selling his soul to the devil. </p>
    <p class="there">There is a vivid likeness between Paganini and Carson’s ability to push boundaries.</p>
    <p class="throughout">throughout Paganini’s career he invented</p>
    <p class="numerous">numerous techniques for the violin which</p>
    <p class="rebelled">rebelled</p>
    <p class="against">against the rules of the guarded music<br>scene of that time.</p>
    <div class="sixcols">
        <div class="col-half">
            <p>He was the first to implement showmanship into his performances such as tricks like severing strings and
                finishing his piece on the remaining ones. His work undoubtedly became the first of its kind and many
                artists began to imitate his work.</p>
            <p>Carson also made the conscious choice to betray the academic rules of
                graphic design, maybe an effect of his lack of formal education. He made mistakes and ignored the
                conventional methods, such as organised type with correct spacing. But without rule breaking we will
                never see development. Both artists paved created media unseen before their time which valued emotion
                over function.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-second-half">
            <p>In both of their endeavours, there is an imposing question if their work is intended for solely those
                with elite status. Paganini’s work was so complicated that it could only be understood by those who
                understood musical techniques, and at that time that was recognised by the people of high society.</p>
            <p>In a similar vein, Carson’s work appealed to a niche collection of people with an interest in avant-gardism,
                something the common man would be too busy to look into. The everyday person often found his layouts and
                layering very difficult to dissect. So not only were their audiences majorly composed of “elite” status
                people, it was also something that they were both shamed for appealing to.</p>

        <p class="top-leftprgh">Critics of Paganini claim that he uses flashy techniques to<br>hide his mediocre composing abilities. This
            is extremely<br>reminiscent of critics discussing Carson’s style. Their work<br>was so out of the norm that
            they both accumulated a<br>broken audience.</p>
        <p class="top-rightprgh">You either love or hate Paganini’s work, and the same can<br>be said for Carson. Carson was such a big target for abuse<br>because he
            was creating a movement that ignored fear of<br>development that would inspire a new generation.</p>
        <p class="leftprgh">So, can Carson be considered the Paganini of graphic design? Undoubtedly<br>yes. There are
            stark parallels
            between both their careers, particularly the fact<br>that they were one of the few rule breakers of their
            time.
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>Carson found new ways of engaging with type and image that was not seen before in print. His style was informed
        by his interests outside the design world, which made his work and style so unique. The constant experimentation
        with bold colour and forms allowed for him to receive recognition from successful brands such as Microsoft and
        Levi’s and in turn, progress as a brand designer. </p>
</div>
    
    <div class="seven">
        <p> Paganini and Carson also shared the trait that their work did not suit a large audience. As a result, they
            received harsh criticism from both their audience and the media. While Carson’s work remains divisive, it has
            undeniably influenced modern graphic design. Graphic designers
            today
            realise that you can stray from the rules and still create a piece that conveys their intended message,
            maybe
            even more so than taking the conventional path.</p>
