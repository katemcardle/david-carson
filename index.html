        <div class="bottom-right">David Carson redefined the rules of<br>visual communication and design<br>culture, much like Paganini’s<br>techniques
            in classical performance<br>over a century prior. Carson<br>was a highly influential designer in<br>the late 1980’s
            and 1990’s, who<br>is best known for his “grunge” style<br>that breaks away from the traditional<br>regulations of
            graphic design.<br>His work is the ultimate symbol<br>of experimentation which can be<br>accredited in the
            regeneration of<br>young designers’ interest in the<br>medium. He perfectly captures the<br>need for revolution
            during that<br>time in his own words, “Graphic<br>design is a visual language. And<br>like any language, it needs to
            be<br>constantly evolving and changing to<br>remain relevant. </div>

                    <p>Carson’s work is the definition of personal style. He had very little education</p>
                    <p>in design so observed the techniques used in the pop culture that he enjoyed.</p>
                    <p>This allowed him to discover his eclectic style. The consistent elements of his</p>
                    <p>work are chaotic and unstructured typography, large and bold photographs, a lack</p>
                    <p>of a grid, and layering of gritty material. Many of his pieces can be described</p>
                    <p>as a grainy collage. Each artwork seems like a different style to the last because</p>
                    <p>Carson does not follow guides or rules. The only rule that he adheres to is</p>
                    <p>that he follows none, resulting in pure disorder guided by his own intuition. “His</p>
                    <p> work sought to reconnect with audiences for whom print had failed in its emotional range,</p>
                    <p> and as a result had often failed to engage readers at all.”</p>

                    <p>As humans, we are inclined to resist change. From an evolutionary standpoint, it may be</p>
                    <p>down to the fact that it was too dangerous to leave familiar places. This can be the</p>
                    <p>answer as to why Carson received such strong criticism to his work. He was accused of </p>
                    <p>having illegible designs and no style, and on the other end of the spectrum, using</p>
                    <p>style to hide the absence of a concept. Standing with his work and process, he argued </p>
                    <p>that creativity and emotional response is far more valuable than rule following and </p>
                    <p>lackluster communication. His famous quote, "Don’t confuse legibility with communication," </p>
                    <p>further reflects his belief that design travels beyond simplicity.</p>

        <p>While Carson’s work remains divisive, it has undeniably influenced modern graphic design. Graphic designers
            today
            realise that you can stray from the rules and still create a piece that conveys their intended message,
            maybe
            even more so than taking the conventional path.</p>
